# JavaScript Errors and Debugging

Two of the most common challenges developers face are debugging and dealing with
errors. This is especially true for junior developers like yourself. The goal
of this lab is to give you exposure to some of the most common JavaScript errors
and what causes them.

Errors and bugs can have a variety of causes. For example,

- Missing an important piece of syntax (like `]`, `)`, `,`).
- Inaccurate access of an object property or an item in an array.
- Inaccurate or incomplete logic.
- Incorrect usage of a method.

JavaScript will throw an error to the console with a message explaining (as best it can) what
the cause is. Interpreting these messages is a _learned skill_, one you will have the
opportunity to practice in this lab!

## Prerequisites

- JavaScript data types and control flow
- Working with JavaScript objects and arrays
- JavaScript functions and methods
- Array methods

## Instructions

1. Download this repository to your computer.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Work through the prompts in [`lib/errors.md`](lib/errors.md).
1. We've provided an html file inside of `lib/` that you can use to test out the
   code. Cut and paste each code snippet to the html file and review the results in the browser.
1. Provide your answers to the questions below in the `errors.md` file.

> Remember that we will not be turning in labs to be graded, so there is no need to fork and clone this directory.

## Requirements

This lab contains 11 prompts inside [`lib/errors.md`](lib/errors.md). Each
prompt includes a short snippet of JavaScript code that has an error or bug in
it. Your task is to review the code and the error it creates, then determine the
cause of the error and how you can fix it.

For the purposes of this lab, focus on using the console to log messages. Cut and paste the code between the `script` tags in `lib/errors.md` in between the script tags of your `lib/index.html` file.

Each prompt asks three questions:

1. What is the error message?
1. What is causing the error?
1. How can you resolve/fix the error?

Write your answers inside of [`lib/errors.md`](lib/errors.md). Your answers can
be written or you can provide a fixed code snippet.

Please do not change the original broken code block in the prompts. Make the corrections in the "How can you resolve/fix the error?" section.

**Please format your responses in Markdown. If you would like, see [this cheetsheat](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) to see how to do add additional formatting beyond plain text.**

## Hungry for More?

If you finish with these 11 bugs and would like more challenges, explore some of the specifically [debugging Katas](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/javascript?q=&r%5B%5D=-8&r%5B%5D=-7&r%5B%5D=-6&tags=Bugs&beta=false) on Code Wars. Make sure to create a Code Wars account (you can log in via GitHub) to track your progress on the site, as it is a great outside resource.

If you would like practice using Chrome and/or VS Code's built-in debugger, go back and try debugging the broken code with those tools.
